[input.txt] contains text in French with many *cough-cough* funny characters.

You want to "simplify" the text by removing the accents and cedillas. This
could be used to normalize text for comparison, especially when it comes to
search.

For example:

 é -> e
 ç -> c
 à -> a
 (so on...)

Try not to hardcode the solution. Aim for a robust solution that would work
with other languages.

*** NOTES ***

This might be one of those you-either-know-or-you-don't kind of problem. Don't
let it drive you crazy.

If you don't get exactly the behavior you want on Mac OS X, this page might be
of interest: http://bit.ly/ea7R2i -- it's also a spoiler if you haven't figured
out how to solve the problem.
