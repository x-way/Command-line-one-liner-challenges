CHAPTER II

SATURDAY morning was come, and all [1;31mthe[0m summer world was bright and[0m[K
fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if
[1;31mthe[0m heart was young [1;31mthe[0m music issued at [1;31mthe[0m lips. There was cheer in[0m[K
every face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom
and [1;31mthe[0m fragrance of [1;31mthe[0m blossoms filled [1;31mthe[0m air. Cardiff Hill, beyond[0m[K
[1;31mthe[0m village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far[0m[K
enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.

Tom appeared on [1;31mthe[0m sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a[0m[K
long-handled brush. He surveyed [1;31mthe[0m fence, and all gladness left him and[0m[K

whitewashed streak with [1;31mthe[0m far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed[0m[K
fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at
[1;31mthe[0m gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from[0m[K
[1;31mthe[0m town pump had always been hateful work in Tom's eyes, before, but[0m[K
now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at
[1;31mthe[0m pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there[0m[K
waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling,
fighting, skylarking. And he remembered that although [1;31mthe[0m pump was only[0m[K
a hundred and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of
water under an hour--and even then somebody generally had to go after
him. Tom said:
